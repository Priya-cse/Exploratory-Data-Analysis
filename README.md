# Exploratory-Data-Analysis-For-Covid-Vaccination
## Problem Statement
Our dataset explores the rise of Covid and effect of vaccinations on Covid, which ultimately helped us to reach the milestone of 1 billion vaccinations in India. 
## Objectives
- Compare the variation of tests, cases and deaths in year 2020 and 2021.
- Analyze the effect of vaccination on cases, deaths, positive rate and death rate.
- Observe and note the patterns in vaccinations.
- Compare the effect of first and second dose of vaccinations on cases and deaths.
## Data Description
- The given dataset is the daily basis count in Covid and vaccination sector.
- It summarizes the information regarding the number of Covid cases,  deaths, Covid tests and the status of vaccination.
- The data helps to analyze the situation of approximately 2 years of data till Dec 15, 2021, the pre-release of vaccine in the first year and post-release of vaccine in the second year.
- This dataset comprises 50 columns(attributes) and 686 rows(tuples).

## Conclusion
- Testing helped to detect more cases and hence, reducing severe cases of covid.
- In general, as cases increased, deaths also increased. But deaths did depend on cases.
- Vaccination did not affect much on the number of cases or positive rate.
- Cases mostly depended on waves of covid and other factors.
- Vaccination affected the number of deaths by increasing the immunity of the people which is seen in further days or months.
- Vaccinations depended on waves of covid and other factors.
- There were more first dose vaccinations compared to second dose vaccinations.
